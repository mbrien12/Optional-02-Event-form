## Background & Objectives

You are an event organizer, and you want to set up a registration form for this event.
Guest should be able to choose between several meals, and several workshops.
Be creative! The goal is to use as many form components as possible: checkboxes, radios, selects, textareas, etc.

## Specs

- Update the `form.html` and add your own `<form>` in here
- Add some CSS rules in `style.css` to make your form look nicer
